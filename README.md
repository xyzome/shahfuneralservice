### This is a Corporate Events - Conferences and Seminars website. I have implemented some fundamentals in terms of navigation, user authentication, error handling, dynamic content display, showcasing services, and facilitating ticket purchases for events. These functionalities are crucial for providing a comprehensive and user-friendly experience to visitors.

- ### Router Implementation: A router allows for seamless navigation between different pages or sections of website without requiring a full page refresh. 

- ### Firebase Authentication: Firebase authentication is a secure way to handle user authentication to allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts securely.

- ### 404 Page: A 404 page is a custom error page that displays when a user attempts to access a non-existent or broken link.

- ### Services Page: The services page likely provides information about the various event management services offers. It could include details about event planning, coordination, marketing, ticketing, etc.

- ### Tickets Option: The tickets option to provide knowledge users to purchase event tickets through.
